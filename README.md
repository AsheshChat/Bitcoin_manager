# Bitcoin_manager
# Basic Bitcoin Wallet Manager

A simple command-line-based Bitcoin wallet manager implemented in C++. This application allows you to generate a new Bitcoin key pair, display the public address for receiving Bitcoin, and send Bitcoin to a recipient address (for demonstration purposes).

Please note that this is a basic implementation meant for educational purposes only. It does not interact with the real Bitcoin network and should not be used for managing actual Bitcoin transactions or funds.

## Requirements

- C++ compiler that supports C++11 or higher
- [libbitcoin-system](https://github.com/libbitcoin/libbitcoin-system) library

Make sure you have the libbitcoin-system library installed before running the application.

## Build and Run

1. Clone this repository:https://github.com/AsheshChat/Bitcoin_manager.git


2. Build the application:g++ -std=c++11 -o bitcoin_wallet_manager bitcoin_wallet_manager.cpp -lbitcoin-system


3. Run the application:./bitcoin_wallet_manager


## Usage

When you run the application, it will generate a new Bitcoin key pair and display the public address associated with the generated private key. You can share this public address with others to receive Bitcoin.

To send Bitcoin (for demonstration purposes), follow these steps:

1. Enter the recipient's Bitcoin address when prompted.
2. Enter the amount of Bitcoin you want to send when prompted.

Please note that this sending functionality is a simulation and does not actually interact with the Bitcoin network. In a real-world application, you would need to implement proper blockchain interactions to send actual Bitcoin.

## Security Warning

Managing real Bitcoin transactions and funds requires in-depth knowledge of blockchain technology, cryptography, and security considerations. The code provided here is a simple educational example and should not be used for real-world applications without appropriate security measures and extensive testing.
